			<h2 class="girl-name">Fearless Girl</h2>

			<p>Fearless Girl is a bronze sculpture by Kristen Visbal depicting a girl looking at the well-known Charging Bull (or "Wall Street bull") statue. It was installed on March 7, 2017, at Bowling Green in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. The statue measures approximately 50 inches (130 cm) tall, and weighs about 250 pounds (110 kg).
			<br>
			<br>
			Fearless Girl was commissioned by investment firm State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) as an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership. The plaque below the statue states, "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference," with "SHE" being both a descriptive pronoun and the fund's NASDAQ ticker symbol.
